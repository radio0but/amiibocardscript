# Amiibo Cards Generator Suite

This project contains two Python applications for creating ready-to-print PDFs of Amiibo cards. It includes `AmiiboCardsDownloader.py` for downloading and selecting images and `AmiiboCardsPrintPrep.py` for generating the final PDF file. This project uses AmiiboAPI for data. The AmiiboCardsPrintPrep.py is specifically calibrated for NFC cards 5.44cm x 8.55cm tested on an HP DeskJet 3630 printer.

Big new the GTK version is no a one window application !!!!!

Making amiibo cards sticker is now more straightforward, thanks to a new launcher script(start.py) that guides users through the process.

### For Linux Users:

Simply download and run installer.sh. This will install the software on your system.
In most desktop environments (DEs), the amiiboGenerator app will be visible in the utility section of your application menu.

The App gets installed in the user's home directory because the app is moving creating deleting file in its folder. It needs too much permissions to be in a System folder.

Thats the GTK version This is the default version for linux (install.sh)

Thats the Qt Version on linux

### For Windows Users:

I've provided a Windows installer named AmiiboCardGeneratorSuite_Install.exe.
This version utilizes QT, which offers a smoother experience on Windows.
Please ensure that Python is installed on your system. Also, make sure it's correctly configured in the Path as python.exe. 

The App as to be installed in the user's directory because the app is moving creating 
 and deleting file in its folder. It needs too much permissions to be in a System folder.

## Adding Python and pip to PATH on Windows

1. First, ensure that Python is installed. If not, download the installer from [the official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   
   **Note**: During the installation of Python, there's an option at the bottom of the installation window that says "Add Python to PATH." If you select this, you can skip the manual steps below.

2. If you've already installed Python without adding it to PATH, follow these steps:

   a. Open the `Start` menu, type `Environment Variables`, and select `Edit the system environment variables`.
   
   b. In the `System Properties` window, click the `Environment Variables` button.
   
   c. Under `User variables` or `System variables`, find the `PATH` variable and select it. Click the `Edit` button.
   
   d. In the `Edit Environment Variable` window, click the `New` button and paste in the path to your Python's directory (typically `C:\PythonXX`, where `XX` is the version number, like `C:\Python39`).
   
   e. Click `New` again and add the path to the `Scripts` directory inside your Python directory (typically `C:\PythonXX\Scripts`).
   
   f. Click `OK` to close each of the windows.

3. To verify that Python and pip are now part of your PATH, open a new command prompt and type:

```bash
python.exe --version
pip.exe --version
```

You should see the versions of Python and pip displayed. If not, ensure that you've added the correct paths in step 2.
